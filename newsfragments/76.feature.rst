Mark ABI types with optional attributes.

* ``ABIFunction`` requires ``type`` and ``name`` but ``inputs`` and ``outputs`` are optional.
* ``ABIEvent`` requires ``type`` and ``name`` but ``inputs`` and ``anonymous`` are optional.
* All attributes of ``ABIFunctionInfo`` are required.
* ``ABIFallback`` and ``ABIReceive`` now require the ``type`` attribute.
* ``ABIConstructor`` requires a ``type`` but ``inputs`` are optional.
* ``ABIError`` requires ``type`` and ``name`` but ``inputs`` is optional.
* ``ABIComponent`` requires ``type`` and ``name`` but ``components`` may be omitted so that ``inputs`` may use either ``primitive`` or ``tuple`` types. (`#76 <https://github.com/ethereum/eth-typing/issues/76>`__)
