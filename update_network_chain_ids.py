Script that syncs Network ChainId constants in eth_typing/networks.py 
with the current list of networks from chainid.network.

To run the script:

.. code-block:: shell

    $ python update_network_chain_ids.py

After running the command, check the output in eth_typing/networks.py

If all looks good, open a PR with the changes.
